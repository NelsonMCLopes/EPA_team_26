# GoLP – EPA Team

**Experimental Plasma Accelerators (EPA)**  
Grupo de Lasers e Plasmas (GoLP)  
Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear (IPFN) – Instituto Superior Técnico  

The EPA team focuses on the experimental development of plasma-based particle accelerators, both laser-driven and beam-driven.  
Our activities include the development of long, scalable plasma sources for the AWAKE experiment at CERN, as well as advanced gas targets and diagnostics for Laser Wakefield Acceleration.  
These efforts aim at the generation of high-quality electron and X-ray beams for applications such as X-ray microscopy, microtomography, FEL seeding, and advanced radiation sources.

## Research Areas
- Plasma sources for beam-driven plasma accelerators (AWAKE)
- Laser Wakefield Acceleration and advanced gas targets
- Plasma diagnostics (interferometry, spectroscopy, Thomson scattering)
- Experimental laser–plasma interaction and high-gradient acceleration
- Development of complex experimental apparatus for plasma accelerator research

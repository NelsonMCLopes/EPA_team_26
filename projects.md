## Discharge Plasma Sources for Particle Accelerators

Development of long and high-repetition-rate discharge plasma sources for particle accelerator
applications, with a focus on stability, reproducibility, and scalability.

This research includes contributions to the AWAKE experiment at CERN, namely the development of length-scalable Discharge Plasma Sources (DPS) in collaboration with CERN and Imperial College London. 

Funding: FCT ([2024.00263.CERN](https://doi.org/10.54499/2024.00263.CERN))

## Laser Wakefield Accelerator Targets

Design and development of gas cells and gas targets for laser wakefield accelerators,
including thermally controlled systems for improved beam control and quality.

Funding: FCT ([2022.06871.PTDC](https://doi.org/10.54499/2022.06871.PTDC))

## Pulsed Power Systems for Plasma Sources

Research and development of compact and reliable pulsed power systems for discharge plasma sources,
covering high-voltage switching, repetition rate optimization, and system integration.

---

## Diagnostics for Plasma-Based Accelerators

Development and application of diagnostics for plasma density, discharge characterization,
and beam–plasma interaction studies in plasma accelerator experiments.

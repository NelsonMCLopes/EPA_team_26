# Selected Research Projects

The EPA team conducts experimental research on plasma-based accelerators and related technologies,
including the development of plasma sources, diagnostics, and pulsed power systems.

---

## Discharge Plasma Sources for Particle Accelerators

Development of long and high-repetition-rate discharge plasma sources for particle accelerator
applications, with a focus on stability, reproducibility, and scalability.

This research includes contributions to the AWAKE experiment at CERN.

*Funding: FCT (project reference, if applicable)*

---

## Laser Wakefield Accelerator Targets

Design and development of gas cells and gas targets for laser wakefield accelerators,
including thermally controlled systems for improved density stability and beam quality.

---

## Pulsed Power Systems for Plasma Sources

Research and development of compact and reliable pulsed power systems for discharge plasma sources,
covering high-voltage switching, repetition rate optimization, and system integration.

---

## Diagnostics for Plasma-Based Accelerators

Development and application of diagnostics for plasma density, discharge characterization,
and beam–plasma interaction studies in plasma accelerator experiments.

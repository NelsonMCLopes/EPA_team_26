## Discharge Plasma Sources for Particle Accelerators

Development of long and high-repetition-rate discharge plasma sources for particle accelerator
applications, with a focus on stability, reproducibility, and scalability.

This research includes contributions to the AWAKE experiment at CERN.

Funding: FCT ([2024.00263.CERN](https://doi.org/10.54499/2024.00263.CERN))

---

## Laser Wakefield Accelerator Targets

Design and development of gas cells and gas targets for laser wakefield accelerators,
including thermally controlled systems for improved density stability and beam quality.

---

## Pulsed Power Systems for Plasma Sources

Research and development of compact and reliable pulsed power systems for discharge plasma sources,
covering high-voltage switching, repetition rate optimization, and system integration.

Funding: FCT ([2022.06871.PTDC](https://doi.org/10.54499/2022.06871.PTDC))
